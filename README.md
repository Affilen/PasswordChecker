# PasswordChecker
It's an app that checks how strong is the password
Simple as it gets: 
    -run the passwordstrengthchecker.py (cool name right?)
    - enter your password 
    - that's it, it will tell you your password is missing something or everything is alright and it will score the password
    - it will also hash your password and it will generate it to the terminal
